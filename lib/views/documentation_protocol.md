### Level 0: Glorified `cURL`

See also [cURL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL).

Many asset projects, like jQuery and Ember, already publish their built files
to a CDN. If AHAB is to succeed it *must* work with these files. Bower does
this well, and its behavior is a good starting place.

Given the following `ahab.json` file

    {
      "assets": [
        { "name": "ember": "url": http://builds.emberjs.com/release/ember.js" }
      ]
    }

running `ahab fetch` will put the contents of
`http://builds.emberjs.com/release/ember.js` into `ahab_assets/ember.js`.

At Level 0, the system is essentially a glorified `cURL`. It gives developers a
single file that lists asset dependencies and fetches them automatically. It
does not, however provide for automatic fetching of dependencies of
dependencies, nor does it help the consumer update dependency versions easily
or guard against conflicting version requirements.

### Level 1: Symbolic Lookup

See also [RFC 6570, URI Templates](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570).

Package managers like Rubgems, Bower, and NPM all allow symbolic lookup of
packages based on a `name` and `version`. In Bower, the syntax is

    {
      "assets": [
        { "name": "ember", "version": "1.0.0" }
      ]
    }

This removes a hurdle for developers as they no longer have to go looking for
URLs for each dependency. This feature requires a resolver. This usually
takes the form of a central server. Most package managers allow you to specify
an ordered list of several such servers.

The simplest thing that could possible work as a registry is a URI template.
Given the following `ahab.json` file,

    {
      "registries": [
        "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/{name}/{version}/{name}.js"
      ],

      "assets": [
        { "name": "jquery", "version": "2.0.1" }
      ]
    }

`ahab fetch` will put the contents of
`https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.1/jquery.js` into
`ahab_assets/jquery.js`.

For a registry that exposes a single endpoint with query parameters instead of
predictable URLs, use a URI template like
`https://myregistry.com/asset?name={name}&version={version}`.

If a package has its own URI scheme, you can either add it to the list of
global registries or set the URI template as the package's URL:

    {
      "registries": [
        "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/{name}/{version}/{name}.js"
      ],

      "assets": [
          { "name": "jquery", "version": "2.0.1" } // use the cdnjs registry,

          {
            "name": "ember",
            "url": "http://builds.emberjs.com/tags/v{version}/ember.prod.js",
            "version": "1.0.0"
          }
        }
      ]
    }

### Level 2: Self-Describing Symbolic Lookup

Registries MAY choose to provide a `Link rel="ahab-uri-template‚Äù` header. For
servers that do, the user may use a simple URL instead of a URI template.
Given the following `ahab.json` file

    {
      "registries": [
        "https://ahab.io"
      ],

      "assets": [
        { "name": "jquery", "version": "2.0.1" }
      ]
    }

`ahab fetch` will

 1. determine that the registry URI does not have the required URI template
    parameters
 1. make an `OPTIONS` request to `https://ahab.io`
 1. look for a `Link rel="http://ahab.io/documentation/x-asset-registry-uri"` header
 1. if the header is found, use its content as the registry URI template
 1. if the header is not found, print a warning that the registry is incomplete
